### Docspin

*Summer 2010*

Docspin is an iOS application for Apple iPad and iPhone that enhances slide presentation with interactive real-time 3D content. I developed Docspin in preparation for the Fall 2010 offering of [Interactive Computer Graphics][icg], as I wanted an ideal mechanism for delivering 3D mathematics and source code. Course content is defined in PDF making non-interactive versions of content universally distributable, and enabling high quality mathematical typesetting with LaTeX. Docspin supports inter-document linking, embedded speakers notes, thumbnail browsing, zoom-and-pan source code listings of arbitrary length, and video-out for classroom projection.
