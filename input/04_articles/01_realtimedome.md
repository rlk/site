## [Real-time Digital Dome Rendering][realtimedome]

*1 July 2008*

[This article][realtimedome] enumerates several GPU-accelerated approaches to the problem of real-time 3D rendering using multi-projector edge-blended digital dome displays. A variety of spherical correction approaches are described, organized in terms of the GPU capability that each exploits. This paper emerged from work performed with the staff of the [Space Visualization Laboratory][svl] at the Adler Planetarium, using [Adler's Definiti Space Theater][definiti]. This paper was presented at the [2008 meeting of the International Planetarium Society][ips2008].
