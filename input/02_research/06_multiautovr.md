## [A Multi-viewer Tiled Autostereoscopic Virtual Reality Display][vrst2010]

*2010*

[This paper][vrst2010] documents the development of the [Autostereo Interleaver][interleaver] and its application to a large-scale multi-user autostereoscopic display. The primary contributions of this work include the use of linescreen shift to &ldquo;synchronize&rdquo; the lenticulars of a large number of autostereo displays, causing them to behave in concert as a single large display, and the application of user tracking to mitigate some of the issues in autostereo display. This work was presented at [ACM VRST 2010 in Hong Kong][talk]. The image to the left shows the [KAUST REVE][reve], described in [this article][future] on the future of the CAVE.
