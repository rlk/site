## [TacTile Multitouch Table][tactile]

*2008&ndash;2009*

One of the last projects that I contributed to during my time at EVL was the creation of the [TacTile Multi-touch LCD table][tactile]. The TacTile works on the [FTIR][] principle, but differs from contemporary FTIR displays in its use of a high-definition LCD instead of a projector display, and the use of multiple overlapping infrared sensing cameras for increased resolution. The EVL prototype was demonstrated at SC'08 in Austin. The image at the left shows the TacTile that I constructed and installed at [CCT][] / LSU, and used for two semesters of [CSC 4263 Video Game Design][csc4263].
