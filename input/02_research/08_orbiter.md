## Orbiter: Moonwall Mk II

*Spring 2012*

The original [Moonwall][moonwall-adler] installation used the [Tellurion][] renderer. In 2012 a new Moonwall implementation, based on the [Panoview][] renderer, was created. This new renderer allows for significantly larger data sets to be displayed with increased efficiency. A YouTube video titled [LRO and the Real-time 3D Moon&rdquo;][youtube1] demonstrates its capabilities. Another video, [&ldquo;A Lazy Orbit of the Moon&rdquo;][youtube2] uses this technology to provide a relaxing look at the moon in close-up. Here is a [gallery of screenshots][gallery].
