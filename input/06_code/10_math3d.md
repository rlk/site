### [3D Mathematics Library][math3d]

The [3D math module][math3d] implements a right-handed 3D mathematics library supporting three-component vectors, four-by-four matrices, quaternions, and Euler angles. These values are represented using ordinary C arrays of type *real*, which may be compile-time represented using *float* or *double*. Matrix layout is directly compatible with O<small>PEN</small>GL.
