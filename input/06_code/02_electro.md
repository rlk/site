*Spring 2005&mdash;2009*

Electro is an application development environment designed for use on both cluster-driven tiled displays and desktop systems. Electro is based on the [MPI][] process model and is bound to the [Lua programming language][]lua]. With support for 3D graphics, 2D graphics, audio, and input handling, Electro provides an easy-to-use scripting system for interactive applications spanning multiple processors and displays. Electro supports Linux, Windows 2K/XP, and Mac OS X. Electro has been used by students in [CS426 Video Game Programming][cs426] in 2005 and 2006, and has formed the basis for numerous applications and art pieces at [EVL][] and elsewhere.
