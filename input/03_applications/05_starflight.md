### [StarFlight][]

*Fall 2006*

StarFlight is an [Electro][] application based upon [Total Perspective Vortex][vortex] developed at the University of Chicago's Center for the Presentation of Science. It augments Electro's stellar render with informative GUI overlays and voice-overs in both English and Spanish. This work is on display at the [Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum][adler], and was on exhibit at the [Laboratorio Arte Alameda][alameda] in Mexico City from November 2006 to February 2007.
