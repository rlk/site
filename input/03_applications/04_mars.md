## [Electro][]: Mars

*Summer 2006*

Mars is an Electro application that displays the planet Mars using a demand-paged terrain renderer. The height data is from the [Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA)][mola] at a resolution of 46,080&times;23,040. The color data is a mosaic from Viking Orbiter at 16,384&times;8,192. The planet is presented against the backdrop of [Total Perspective Vortex][vortex]. Source code is included in the [Electro][] distribution, and the data is available upon request. This application was on display at the [Adler Planetarium][adler] and at [Calit2/UCSD][calit2] until 2010.
