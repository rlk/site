### [GIGO][]

*Fall 2012*

[GIGO][] is set of command line utilities providing basic image processing functionality and emphasizing frequency-domain operations. Using out-of-core data access, GIGO is limited only by available disk space. With a pervasive multi-core implementation, GIGO is readily capable of processing gigapixel images in short order, and terapixel images in time. [C99 source code][source] is made available under the terms of the [GNU GPL][gpl].
