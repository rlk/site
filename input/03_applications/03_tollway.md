### [Electro][]: Tollway Simulator

*Summer 2006*

[Tollway Simulator][tollway] is an Electro application that implements a simplified Chicago freeway driving experience. The project was commissioned by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority as part of a study of the signage associated with Open Road Tolling. The implementation depicts a variety of signage designs under a variety of lighting conditions. The installation uses 30-inch Apple Cinema displays, giving visual acuity near the legal standard for licensed drivers. Users are asked to indicate the earliest time at which they are capable of interpreting each sign, and sign designs are evaluated on this basis. The project is described in UIC's [Engineering News][en].
