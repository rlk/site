### [Image Module][image]

The [image module][image] provides support for loading and storing 2D images in PNG, JPEG, TIFF, or EXR format. It is implemented as a very thin abstraction layer atop [libpng][], [libjpeg][], [libtiff][], and [OpenEXR][], any of which may be optionally omitted if not needed.
