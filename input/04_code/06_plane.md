## [Plane Module][plane]

The [plane module][plane] renders a simple gridded plane using OpenGL. The look of it is patterned after the cover of Edward Tufteâ€™s [Visual Explanations][tufte]. The plane is often useful as a backdrop to simple 3D demos, and can help work through those dreaded blank screen bugs. In addition, it represents an example of basic vertex buffer object creation, population, and rendering.
