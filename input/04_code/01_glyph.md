### [Easy Polygonal Text][glyph]

*May 2002*

The [glyph module][glyph] provides an efficient, portable means of rendering polygonal text using O<small>PEN</small>GL. It is fully self-contained and has no external dependencies, giving a trivially easy means of adding simple on-screen text to any O<small>PEN</small>GL application.
