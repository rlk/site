## [View Module][view]

The [view module][view] implements a feature-rich camera for use in interactive 3D graphics applications. It maintains the camera's position, orientation and zoom factor, and provides functions to map user input onto camera control. It also supplies a mechanism for the recording, editing, storage, and play-back of smooth camera motion using quaternion spherical quadradic interpolation. Yep.
