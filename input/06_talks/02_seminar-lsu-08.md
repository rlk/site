## Seminar at Louisiana State University

*16 May 2008*

In May 2008 I was invited to present a seminar at the [Center for Computation and Technology][cct] at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. I presented my thesis work, the planetary-scale terrain composer. CCT's facilities include a [Sony SXRD][sxrd] 4096&times;2048 projector, driven by a PC with a pair of NVIDIA Quadro 4600s, which I used for my live demonstration, shown here.
