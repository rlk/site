### Electro: Mars at Calit2

*2006&mdash;2010*

For a number of years [Mars][] was the primary demonstration of the 60-tile [Varrier][] at [Calit2][] on the campus of the University of California, San Diego. It was the first application to be shown on this Varrier, and the construction of this display provided the motivation for the creation of the Mars visualization during the summer of 2006.
