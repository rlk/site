### 2&times;2 Tiled Displays

*2010&ndash;2011*

In order to have on hand the barest minimum infrastructure necessary for research in cluster parallel rendering, I constructed a mobile 2&times;2 [80/20][8020] LCD mount with four 30&prime;&prime; Apple Cinema displays. This simple structure has proven useful, and served as a 4K display simulator for my course [CSC 4263 Video Game Design][csc4263] as well as [Prof. Brygg Ullmer][ullmer]'s course [CSC 4700 HCI Design &amp; Technology][csc4700]. As of this writing, four copies of the 2&times;2 design have been produced at LSU, including the 5120&times;3200 array in 3 Johnston Hall (shown at left) and the 3840&times;2400 array in 167 Coates (at right).
