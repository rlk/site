### Tellurion on the StarCAVE at Calit2

*2007&mdash;2008*

[Tellurion][] was demonstrated using the StarCAVE at [Calit2][] on the campus of the University of California, San Diego. A direct descendant of [EVL's CAVE][cave] design, the StarCAVE is a 17-screen cylindrical virtual reality display. It uses 34 JVC projectors at 1920&times;1080 to produce circularly polarized passive stereo 3D on 5 walls and the floor. Each pair of projectors is driven by a workstation with an NVIDIA Quadro 5600. 6 degree-of-freedom head and hand tracking is provided by an ART motion tracking system. In this image, the fifth wall slides forward on rails to enclose the environment.
