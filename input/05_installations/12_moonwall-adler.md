### Adler Planetarium Moonwall

*2009&ndash;present*

The [Moonwall][youtube1] is an exhibit in the [Shoot for the Moon][shoot] gallery at the [Adler Planetarium][adler] in Chicago. It consists of 12 NEC X461UN ultra-narrow-bezel LCD displays, totalling 5440&times;2304 pixels over a 13.3&times;5.6 foot area. It provides a high-resolution interactive fly-over of the moon, as represnted by data from NASA's [Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter][lro]. The software is an application of [Tellurion][], the implementation of my doctorial research. My involvement with this project partially funded my Ph.D., continues to fund some of my on-going research, and enabled me to attend the [the launch of LRO/LCROSS][youtube2].
