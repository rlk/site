### [Kinect + 3D TV = Virtual Reality][youtube]

*February 2011*

[Kinect + 3D TV = Virtual Reality][youtube] creates an inexpensive immersive virtual reality display environment from consumer-grade components. Stereoscopic viewing is provided by a Panasonic 3D plasma TV and user tracking by a Microsoft Kinect. Skeletal tracking uses [OpenNI][], shown here running on an Ubuntu Linux PC with NVIDIA graphics. The renderer is [Electro][] and the demonstration includes [Total Perspective Vortex][vortex]. The head tilt (toward the end of the video) is a distinguishing characteristic of this system. This work was publicly demonstrated at [LSU's TechPAWlooza 2011][techpawlooza] and cited by the MIT Technology Review in an article placing gestural interfaces [among the top 10 emerging technologies of 2011][tr].
