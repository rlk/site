### [Passing: Place for Games][passing]

*4&ndash;6 August 2009*

In July 2006, UIC Art &amp; Design professor [Daria Tsoupikova][tsoupikova] and I traveled to [Kizhi Island][kizhi] in Lake Onega, Republic of Karelia, Russia, to document the 300-year-old wooden cathedrals found there. We recreated the scene in an interactive virtual reality experience, which we demonstrated on the small screen in the [Information Aesthetics Showcase][ias] at [SIGGRAPH 2009][siggraph09] in New Orleans.
