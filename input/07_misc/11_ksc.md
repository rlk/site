### Kennedy Space Center Panoramas

*June 2009*

In June of 2009 we were invited to Kennedy Space Center to view the launch of the Atlas V rocket carrying <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/main/index.html">LRO</a> and <a href="http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/">LCROSS</a> to the moon. While awaiting the launch at the <a href="http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/apollo-saturn-v-center.aspx">Saturn V Center</a>, I captured a few high-resolution panoramas: <a href="http://cct.lsu.edu/~rkooima/images/kscview.jpg">the view from the VIP viewing stand</a> including both Shuttle pads (and Shuttle Endeavour), the Atlas pad, and the VAB, <a href="http://cct.lsu.edu/~rkooima/images/saturnv-1.jpg">a view of the Saturn S-II second stage</a>, <a href="http://cct.lsu.edu/~rkooima/images/saturnv-2.jpg">view of the Saturn S-IVB third stage</a>, and finally <a href="http://cct.lsu.edu/~rkooima/images/businessend.jpg">a photo of the Saturn's five F-1 engines</a>.
