### [GPGPU Knot Simulation][proj3]

*Spring 2006*

My third project for UIC's [GPU Programming][cs525] course crossed over with [Lou Kauffman][kauffman]'s course on [Knot Theory][math569], which I attended concurrently. The project implements a constrained particle dynamics system using GLSL pixel shaders. It simulates an electrically charged loop of ribbon. This was motivated by an ongoing collaboration between Kauffman and EVL co-founder [Dan Sandin][dan]. They simulated knots in an effort to support the hypothesis that electrostatic repulsion would necessarily untie any non-knot loop. This GPU-based simulation allowed them to scale up their data set size by two orders of magnitude. The ribbon representation also enabled investigation of an apparent property of conservation of twist and coil in physical knots. This application has been ported to the [Personal Varrier][varrier] virtual reality system.
