### [Helvetica vs. Arial][pdf]

*December 2009*

Many people feel deeply about the use of [Helvetica][] and [Arial][]. The prevailing opinion is that Helvetica is a thing of beauty while Arial is an affront to the eye. These opinions may be rooted more in the history of these two fonts than in their design, and the scorn may be more toward Microsoft than toward the angled terminals. Discounting range, the differences are slim. To make these differences clear, I've overlaid Helvetica in magenta with Arial in cyan, and shown their intersection in black.
