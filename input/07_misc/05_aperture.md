### [Xcode 4 Color Theme "Aperture"][aperture]

Here's a custom color theme for Xcode 4 that I find appealing. Contrary to most syntax themes, this one is defined entirely in terms of a single hue, amber at 45&deg;. Syntax categories are distinguished by brightness, with keywords set in bold, program text in regular, and comments in italic. I use it with 13 point Consolas, as I really appreciate Consolas' italic. This theme is reminiscent of a VT420 MicroVAX console I used many years ago, but it'll probably remind most of the displays found at [Aperture Laboratories][portal].

Place it in *~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/*
