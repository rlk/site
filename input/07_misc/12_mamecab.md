### MAME "Cabinet"

*Spring 2012 work-in-progress*

My ongoing [MAME][] cabinet project is a departure from the norm. I want to preserve the form factor of the 1980s vertical arcade experience, but reinterpret it using lighter materials available today: LCD instead of CRT, [80/20 extruded aluminum][8020] and HDPE instead of MDF or plywood, LED instead of fluorescent lighting, and laser-cut acrylic instead of printed vinyl. I started by doing some [CAD and previsualization][arcade0]. The [current state][arcade2] of the real article is [very slim][arcade3], [self-contained][arcade4], and fully functional using an [X-Arcade Tankstick][xgaming]. All graphics and lighting remain to be done, and I'll upgrade to a hand-made control panel as the project proceeds.
