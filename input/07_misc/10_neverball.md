## [Neverball][]

*May 2003&mdash;present*

From 2001 to 2004 I worked 9-to-5 as a real-time visualization researcher at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA. In my free time during this period I developed a game similar to SEGA's [Super Monkey Ball][smb]. I ported it to Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX, and I released it as freeware under the terms of the ]GNU General Public License][gpl]. Its popularity grew rapidly. It has had millions of users and is included on a number of Linux distribution installations. An international community of players, level designers, and Open Source developers formed around the game, meeting at the [Nevercorner Forum][nevercorner]. Work continues to this day, in open source fashion. Our [project site][project] tracks bug reports and hosts a public source code repository and wiki. The game has become a favorite platform for hackers working with motion sensing devices such as the Nintendo Wiimote, the Apple Motion Sensor, and others. Numerous videos may be found on [YouTube][].
