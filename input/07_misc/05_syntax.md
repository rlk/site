### [Color themes][aperture-tmate]

Here are a few custom syntax color themes that I find useful.

"Working" (for [TextMate or Sublime Text][working-tmate]) is a light-on-dark theme resembling Zenburn but without any overly-saturated colors. I use this theme heavily.

"Aperture" (for [XCode 4][aperture-xcode] or for [TextMate or Sublime Text][aperture-tmate]) is unique in that it is defined entirely in terms of a single hue, amber at 45&deg;. Syntax categories are distinguished by brightness, with keywords set in bold, program text in regular, and comments in italic (if available). This theme is reminiscent of a VT420 MicroVAX console I used many years ago, but it'll probably remind most of the displays found at [Aperture Laboratories][portal].
