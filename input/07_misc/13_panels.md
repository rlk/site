### [Control Panel Boxes][panels]

*Spring 2012*

In pursuit of the highest quality controls for use in my visualization work, I've designed and build a pair of boxes using [Ultimarc][] arcade controls, [8020][] extruded aluminum, and laser-cut acrylic. Photos, CAD drawings, and laser-cutting templates are provided [here][panels].
