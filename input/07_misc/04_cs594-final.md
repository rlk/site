## [GPU Day-Night Illumination Tutorial][final]

*Spring 2006*

My final project for UIC's [GPU Programming][cs525] course provides a tutorial on day-night surface illumination using GLSL. It displays four dynamic light sources (two positional and two directional) illuminating a navigable animated scene with full shadow mapping. This application has been ported to the [Personal Varrier][varrier] virtual reality system.
