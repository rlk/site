### [GPU Water Simulation][proj2]

*Spring 2006*

My second project for UIC's [GPU Programming][cs525] course combines CPU-based physics, GPU-based physics, and real-time GPU rendering. An [ODE][] rigid body dynamics system simulates junk littered about an abandoned quarry. Physical objects interacting with the surface of the water drive a Verlet integration of the water's surface, implemented using GLSL pixel shading. GLSL shaders render the scene with per-pixel illumination and shadow mapping. The water surface is rendered with correct Fresnel mixing of reflected and refracted geometry, drawn to off-screen framebuffer objects. Submerged surfaces are rendered with approximated caustics and volumetric fog.
