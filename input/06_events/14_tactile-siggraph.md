## TacTile at SIGGRAPH 2009

*4&ndash;6 August 2009*

The CCT [TacTile][] appeared at [SIGGRAPH 2009][siggraph09] in New Orleans. A few of my students from the Spring 2009 offering of [CSC 4263 Video Game Design][csc4263] came along to demonstrate their work. In addition, LSU professor [Brygg Ulmer][ullmer]'s research group augmented the table with an RFID-sensing tangibles tray for application control and interaction.
