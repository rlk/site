### [Synthesis: Processing and Collaboration][synthesis]

*13 January 2011*

I participated in a panel discussion on collaboration in research with Dan Sandin and Tom DeFanti as a part of the opening of a retrospective of Dan &amp; Tom's work called [Synthesis: Processing and Collaboration][synthesis] at [gallery@Calit2][gallery]. This event also included the opening of a new piece for the StarCAVE entitled [Particle Dreams in Spherical Harmonics][particle-dreams], which I developed with [Dan Sandin][sandin] and [Laurie Spiegel][spiegel].
