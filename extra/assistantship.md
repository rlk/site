# Applying for Assistantship

Inquiring graduate students and prospective research assistants should understand that university faculty receive a great many requests for mentorship each semester, but have very limited resources to provide. Not all inquiries will receive responses. The chance of success is maximized by close attention to the following advice.

1. Address my research.

	No one will take the time to craft a unique response to a non-unique request. If your inquiry is obviously a broadcast, it will simply be ignored. Read my web site. Address my work and describe how your interests relate to it.

2. Show your work.

	As an applied computer scientist, I make software that is useful to others. To work with me, you must demonstrate that you are capable of doing the same. Show me projects that you have completed. The very best approach is to give me a URL to your public source code repository. Let me read the documentation you've written. If you have published any papers, include them.

3. Make certain that your work is in alignment with mine.

	A research mentor will only select an assistant who comes equipped with the background and experience necessary to begin work immediately. Taking a semester or more to be brought up-to-date with the field is a waste of time. In my case, candidates must have a working knowledge of computer graphics, C++, and Linux.

4. Don't pander.

	Many prospective graduate assistants are advised to **embolden all of their key phrases**. This is one of the **hallmarks of a broadcast inquiry** and it reads like **celebrity gossip**. It suggests that I **don't know how to read**. Don't do this. It's disrespectful. Whoever is advising you to do it is wrong.

Sadly, following this advice doesn't guarantee a positive response. A researcher can only hire an assistant when funding is available. Much of the time, available funding is already spoken-for and even an excellent candidate must be passed over due to commitments made to another. It's an unfortunate reality.

If you're externally funded, then by all means contact your first choice of mentor and tell them so. You'll get their attention. But if you're in need of a paycheck or tuition remission, please understand that many research mentors would love to hire you, but simply cannot.
