# Applying for Assistantship

Inquiring graduate students and prospective research assistants should understand that university faculty receive a great many requests for mentorship each semester, but have very limited resources to provide. Not all inquiries will receive responses. The chance of success is maximized by close attention to the following advice.

1. Address my research.

	No one will take the time to craft a unique response to a non-unique request. If your inquiry is obviously a broadcast, it will simply be ignored. Read my web site. Address my work and describe how your interests relate to it.

2. Show your work.

	As an applied computer scientist, I make software that is useful to others. To work with me, you must demonstrate that you are capable of doing the same. Show me projects that you have completed. The very best approach is to give me a URL to your public source code repository. Let me read the documentation you've written. If you have published any papers, include them.

3. Make certain that your work is in alignment with mine.

	A research mentor will only select an assistant who comes equipped with the background and experience necessary to begin work immediately. Taking a semester or more to be brought up-to-date with the field is a waste of time. In my case, candidates must have a thorough knowledge of computer graphics, C++, and Linux.

4. Don't pander.

	Many prospective graduate assistants are advised to **embolden** all of their **key words**. This is one of the **hallmarks of a broadcast inquiry** and it reads like **celebrity gossip**. It suggests that I **don't know how to read**. Don't do this. It's disrespectful. Whoever is advising you to do so is wrong.
