## Sensor Environment Imaging (SENSEI)

*2016&ndash;2017*

Supported by the NSF, the [Development of the Sensor Environment Imaging (SENSEI) Instrument][nsf] is a collaboration led by Maxine Brown of the [Electronic Visualization Lab][evl], including the University of California San Diego, the University of Hawai&#699;i at M&amacr;noa, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Jackson State University, and LSU. The objective of the project is to develop an end-to-end system to capture, deliver, and display omni-stereoscopic video. My role is an extension of work done in [high-resolution omni-stereoscopic still imagery][panoptic] to compress and display the data captured by this device.
