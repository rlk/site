## [Stereoscopic Spherical Panorama Capture][panorama]

*Fall 2011*

In support of my work in high-performance large-scale [spherical data rendering][panoview], I've acquired a [GigaPan EPIC Pro][gigapan] and a stereoscopic camera system developed by [Dick Ainsworth][ainsworth]. With these, I've captured a number of stereoscopic spherical panoramas at sites around Louisiana. Here is a [catalog of these images][panorama], with full-resolution downloads.
