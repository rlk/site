## OLED Virtual Reality Environment

*2016&ndash;2017*

Supported by [LSU Student Technology Fees][stf], with matching support by the [Bert S. Turner Department of Construction Management][cm], [Dr. Yimin Zhu][zhu] and I have created a stereoscopic, immersive, interactive, virtual reality environment using an array of 4K OLED displays. With design assistance by PhD student Sanaz Saeidi and fabrication by [MMR Constructors][mmr], this system will be made available for student use in the renovated and expanded Patrick Taylor Hall.
