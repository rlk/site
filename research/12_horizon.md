## Real-time Shadows for Gigapixel Displacement Maps

*2015&ndash;2016*

[Kevin Cherry][cherry]'s PhD dissertation work is an offshoot of my my own work in [scalable rendering][scm]. Much of my early work was motivated by [visualization of the Moon][orbiter]. The shadows on the Moon, currently studied by scientists pursuing frozen water there, have been of interest since Galileo first used them to measure lunar mountains. The real-time generation of accurate shadows in lunar visualization is complicated by the vast scale of data describing the terrain. Kevin transformed the generation of physically correct soft shadows on arbitrary spherical terrains from a rendering problem to a data problem, implementing his approach as a straightforward add-on to existing visualization tools.
