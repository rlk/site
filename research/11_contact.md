## Multi-Pass Gaussian Contact-Hardening Soft Shadows

*Fall 2014&ndash;Spring 2015*

[Kevin Cherry][cherry] performed a very comprehensive review of real-time shadow generation techniques in support of his [dissertation work][horizon], complete with implementations of all relevant algorithms. Through this work, he discovered and implemented additional means of generating shadow penumbrae. [We presented this work at GRAPP 2015][pdf] in Berlin, Germany.
