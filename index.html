        <p><em>2007&mdash;present</em></p>
        <p>Tellurion implements a highly-scalable real-time planetary terrain composition algorithm. A GPGPU process tessellates terrain geometry in real time, and transitions smoothly from planet scale down to sub-meter resolution. Tellurion enables the investigation of a class of generalized terrain composition operators that merge data of widely disparate resolution, projection, and coverage on the fly. These composition operations are uniformly applicable to both terrain height maps and surface maps. The cluster-parallel renderer is supported by a multi-threaded data paging mechanism that performs view-dependant loading of data sources of arbitrary size. The system has been demonstrated displaying 115GB of data in real time, including height data covering the U.S. at a resolution of 30 meters. See <a href="#installations">below</a> for a listing of several installations. Tellurion is my Ph.D. work.

        <p><em>October 2007</em></p>
        <p>The real-time 3D perspective projection is normally defined in terms of near and far clipping plane distances. These values constrain the range of the scene and control the resolution of the depth buffer. They have the effect of clipping geometry this is too close to or too far from the camera. The Median Distance Projection algorithm reformulates the real-time 3D perspective projection in terms of the median of the scene. It extends the depth buffer range from zero to infinity. It is implemented in terms of a simple drop-in GLSL vertex function.</p>

        <p><em>Spring 2007</em></p>
        <p>The Varrier Combiner is a GPU-based algorithm performing real-time autostereoscopic sub-pixel spatial multiplexing. Such an algorithm is necessary for the correct function of parallax barrier displays such as the <a href="#varrier">Varrier</a>. Prior to this work, autostereo interleaving was a very expensive process which placed a heavy performance burden upon all autostereo applications. By expressing the problem in terms of GLSL vertex and pixel shading, the computational expense is moved to the GPU, which eliminates the performance degradation completely. <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/files/pdf/Kooima-VR07.pdf">Varrier Combiner</a> was presented at IEEE VR 07 and published in the conference proceedings. A <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/rlk/varrier_combiner/varrier_combiner.html">C module</a> implementing the algorithm may be used to port OpenGL applications to the Varrier.</p>

This was motivated by an ongoing collaboration between Kauffman and EVL co-founder <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/dan/">Dan Sandin</a>. They simulated knots in an effort to support the hypothesis that electrostatic repulsion would necessarily untie any non-knot loop. This GPU-based simulation allowed them to scale up their data set size by two orders of magnitude. The ribbon representation also enabled investigation of an apparent property of conservation of twist and coil in physical knots.

This library also provides an API for building, manipulating, and transforming OBJ model data. It automatically computes tangent and bi-tangent vectors for use in tangent-space surface mapping. It is capable of computing a model's average cache miss ratio (ACMR), and sorting index data to minimize this value and thus maximize rendering performance. The built-in OpenGL renderer uses vertex buffer objects for efficiency. The library supports the full OBJ and MTL specifications, with the exception of OBJ free-form curves.</p>

        <p><em>May 2003&mdash;present</em></p>
        <p>From 2001 to 2004 I worked 9-to-5 as a real-time visualization researcher at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA. In my free time during this period I developed a game similar to SEGA's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball">Super Monkey Ball</a>. I ported it to Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX, and I released it as freeware under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. Its popularity grew rapidly. It has had millions of users and is included on a number of Linux distribution installations. An international community of players, level designers, and Open Source developers formed around the game, meeting at the <a href="http://www.nevercorner.net">Nevercorner Forum</a>. Work continues to this day, in true open source fashion. Our <a href="https://s.snth.net/projects/neverball">project site</a> tracks bug reports and hosts a public source code repository and wiki. The game has become a favorite platform for hackers working with motion sensing devices such as the Nintendo Wiimote, the Apple Motion Sensor, and others. Numerous videos may be found on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neverball&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f">YouTube</a>.</p>

        <p>In May 2008 I was invited to present a seminar at the <a href="http://www.cct.lsu.edu/home">Center for Computation and Technology</a> (CCT) at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. I presented my thesis work, the planetary-scale terrain composer. CCT's facilities include a <a href="http://www.sony.com/sxrd">Sony SXRD</a> 4096&times;2048 projector, driven by a PC with a pair of NVIDIA Quadro 4600s, which I used for my live demonstration, shown here.</p>

A direct descendant of <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/pape/CAVE/oldCAVE/CAVE.html">EVL's CAVE</a> design, the StarCAVE is a 17-screen cylindrical virtual reality display. It uses 34 JVC projectors at 1920&times;1080 to produce circularly polarized passive stereo 3D on 5 walls and the floor. Each pair of projectors is driven by a PC with an NVIDIA Quadro 5600. 6 degree-of-freedom head and hand tracking is provided by an ART motion tracking system. In this image, the fifth wall slides forward on rails to enclose the environment.</p>
