## Homework 2

1. (5 points) Describe the state of a stack after each of the following stack operations: push(5), push(6), pop(), push(1), push(9), pop(), pop(), push(3), push(2), pop(), push(0), pop(), pop(), push(4), push(7), pop(), pop(), push(8), pop(), pop(), pop().

1. (10 points) Give a recursive function for removing all the elements in a stack.

1. (5 points) Suppose you have a deque \\(D\\) containing the numbers \\((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)\\), in this order. Suppose further that you have an initially empty queue \\(Q\\). Give a pseudo-code description of a function that uses only \\(D\\) and \\(Q\\) (and no other variables or objects) and results in \\(D\\) storing the elements \\((1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8)\\), in this order.

1. (20 points) Explain how you can implement all the functions of the deque ADT using two stacks.

1. (10 points) Describe an algorithm for counting the number of left external nodes in a binary tree. Straightforwardly then, describe a similar algorithm for counting the number of right external nodes in a binary tree. 

1. (15 points) Describe an algorithm to determine whether a given binary tree is proper.

1. (15 points) Give an \\(O(n)\\)-time algorithm for computing the depth of all the nodes of a tree \\(T\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of nodes of \\(T\\). Specifically, let each node contain an element \\(\mathit{depth}\\) and traverse the tree assigning a correct value to each \\(\mathit{depth}\\).
