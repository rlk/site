## Homework 2

1. (15 points) Describe the state of a stack and the output after each of the following stack operations, starting with an empty stack: push(2), push(4), pop(), push(5), top(), pop(), isempty(), pop().
 
2. (15 points) Describe the state of a queue and the output after each of the following queue operations, starting with an empty queue: enqueue(5), enqueue(2), dequeue(), enqueue(1), dequeue(), dequeue(), size().
 
3. (15 points) Suppose you have a queue $Q$ containing the number $(1,2,3,4,5)$, in this order. Suppose you also have an empty stack $S$. Give a sequence of operations that uses only the stack $S$ and the queue $Q$ (and no other variables or objects) and results in the queue $Q$ storing the number $(4,5,3,2,1)$.
 
4. (20 points) Describe a recursive algorithm for reversing a linked list. Please provide pseudocode.
 
5. (20 points) Explain how you can implement all functions of the stack ADT using two queues. Specifically, given two queues $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ with the standard operations (enqueue, dequeue, isempty, size), describe how you can implement the standard operations (pop, push, top, isempty, size) of a stack $S$. What is the time complexity for pop and push respectively?
 
6. (15 points) Describe a recursive algorithm for counting the depth of a binary tree. The depth is the maximum length of a path from the root to a leaf. For example, the depth of a tree with a single root node $A$ is 1. If the root node $A$ has a left branch "$A$ to $B$ to $C$" and a right branch "$A$ to $D$", then the depth of the tree is 3.
