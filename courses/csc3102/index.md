## Assignments

All homework will be submitted in class on the due date. All programming projects will be submitted via your account on *classes.csc.lsu.edu*. The late penalty is 10% per day. Grades are recorded on the course [Moodle](https://moodle3.lsu.edu/course/view.php?id=2373). Questions about posted grades must be sent to *both* the instructor and the grader. Gradebook entries are finalized one week after an assignment is returned.
