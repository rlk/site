## Homework 3

1. (15 points) Illustrate the execution of the heap-sort algorithm on the following input sequence: (29, 12, 14, 51, 24, 10, 19, 21, 46, 86).
  
3. (15 points) Initially you have an empty heap. Insert entries with keys 29, 40, 14, 39, 74, 63, 24, 15, and 10, in this order. Then remove the three minimum values. Draw the tree after each insertion or removal.

3. (15 points) Initially you have an empty binary search tree. Insert entries with keys 29, 40, 14, 39, 74, 63, 24, 15, and 10, in this order. Then remove the keys 29, 39, and 63, in this order. Draw the tree after each insertion or removal.

3. (20 points) Initially you have an empty AVL tree. Insert entries with keys 29, 40, 14, 39, 74, 63, 24, 15, and 10, in this order. Then remove the keys 29, 39, and 63, in this order. Draw the tree after each insertion or removal.

4. (5 points) Will the operations of deleting $i$ and then $j$ from a binary search tree leave the same tree as deleting $j$ and then $i$? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.

4. (5 points) Will the operations of deleting $i$ and then $j$ from an AVL tree leave the same tree as deleting $j$ and then $i$? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.
