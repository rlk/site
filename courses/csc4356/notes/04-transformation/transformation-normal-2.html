		<h1>Transformation of Normals</h1>

		<p>It is commonly stated in the computer graphics literature that normals are transformed using the transpose of the inverse, often without explanation.</p>

		\[\V{n}'=(\M{M}^{-1})^T\cdot\V{n}\]

		<p>This bears some discussion. Consider a <em>plane equation</em>.</p>

		\[a\,x + b\,y + c\,z + d = 0\]

		<p>This equation defines the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ that fall on the plane $(a, b, c, d)$. This plane faces along the vector $(a, b, c)$ at a distance $d$ to the origin.</p>

		<p>For example, if the top of your desk is 75 cm off the floor then $y=0.75$&nbsp;m for all points on the surface of your desk. The normal vector of the top of your desk faces up, $(0, 1, 0)$, so</p>

		\[0\,x + 1\,y + 0\,z - 0.75 = 0\]

		<p>While we often think of the plane equation as the dot product of two vectors, it's enlightening to phrase it as a matrix product.</p>

		\[\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c & d\end{bmatrix}\cdot
		\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = 0\]

		<p>Here, a position is represented as a column vector, while a plane is represented as a row vector. Take this to be the case universally.</p>

		<p>Now, assume the plane equation holds for a vector $\V{v}=[x, y, z, 1]^T$ and a plane $\V{p}=[a, b, c, d]$. Position $\V{v}$ falls within plane $\V{p}$.</p>

		\[\V{p}\cdot\V{v}=0\]

		<p>Let's transform $\V{v}$.</p>

		\[\V{v}'=\M{M}\cdot\V{v}\]

		<p>The equation no longer holds for that same $\V{p}$.</p>

		\[\V{p}\cdot\V{v}'=\V{p}\cdot\M{M}\cdot\V{v}\neq 0\]

		<p>But we can fix it by introducing the transform inverse, which cancels out the transformation of the position.</p>

		\[\V{p}\cdot\M{M}^{-1}\cdot\M{M}\cdot\V{v}=0\]

		<p>From this we can see that if we transform of plane $\V{p}$ like so,</p>

		\[\V{p}'=\V{p}\cdot\M{M}^{-1}\]

		<p>then the plane equation holds for the transformed position and transformed plane.</p>

		\[\V{p}'\cdot\V{v}'=0\]

		<p>This, therefore, is how planes should transform: multiplied on the left of the inverse matrix.</p>

		<p>But the incumbent mechanisms of computer graphics don't do transformation of row vectors on the left, they do transformation of column vectors on the right. We accommodate this and change a plane transformation into a position transformation simply by taking the transpose of both sides of the equation.</p>

		\[(\V{p}')^T=(\V{p}\cdot\M{M}^{-1})^T\]

		\[(\V{p}')^T=(\M{M}^{-1})^T\cdot(\V{p})^T\]

		<p>In this way, a plane can be treated like a position.</p>

		<p>A normal vector, being an <em>orientation</em>, behaves as a plane rather than a position, with the fourth component $d=0$. As such, it's transformed by the transpose of the inverse.</p>

		\[\V{n}'=(\M{M}^{-1})^T\cdot\V{n}\]
