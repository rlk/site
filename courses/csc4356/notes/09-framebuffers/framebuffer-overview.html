		<h1>Framebuffer Objects</h1>

		<p>The <em>framebuffer</em> is the image to which we render. It has implicitly always been there, with its RGBA color and Z depth buffers, ready to accept the fragments that we draw to the screen.</p>

		<p>A <em>framebuffer object</em> allows us take control of this functionality, to have as many rendering targets as we choose, to determine the size and type of each, and, most-importantly, to <b>render directly to textures</b>.</p>

		<p>This capability has numerous uses:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Producing shadows by pre-rendering a scene from the light source's perspective.</li>
			<li>Producing reflections or refractions by pre-rendering a scene from an object's position.</li>
			<li>Producing full-screen effects such as depth-of-field, motion blur, or exposure by post-rendering with an image-process shader.</li>
		</ul>
