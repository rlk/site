	<h1>Final Project</h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>The purpose of the final is to allow you to explore some aspect of real-time computer graphics that was not covered in class.</p>

  <h2>Specifics</h2>

  <p>The final takes the form of a project similar to those that we've done this semester with one important difference: you may choose the topic. Pick something of interest to you, perhaps something related to your other courses, your career goals, or your ongoing research, if any. Of course, your idea must be approved by the instructor, so contact him in person or by email as early as possible.</p>

	<p>We will have in-class demonstrations lasting up to 10 minutes with a few minutes of discussion. This will take more time than an informal project presentations, so the schedule spans multiple class periods. Here is the order of presentation, randomly generated. Feel free to negotiate changes with your fellow classmates.</p>

	<ul>
	<li><i>(List omitted for documentation)</i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>In addition to the implementation and demonstration, you must provide documentation. Create a web site giving the source code, at least three screen shots of the project running, and a description of what you did and how you did it. Convince the instructor that you understand what you've done. This must be a public site, and your classmates may see it after the semester has ended.</p>
