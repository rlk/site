	<h1>Project 5 &mdash; Scene Management</h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>Project 5 does not develop any new WebGL usage. Instead, it is a programming exercise that entails a generalization of the previous project. This time, we'll have multiple objects and multiple shaders. You'll have to create abstractions to keep all of their WebGL state separate.

	<h2>Specifics</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>As always, copy forward the four WebGL utility libraries and your implementation of the previous project, renaming them for project 5.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>prog4.js</code></li>
				<li><code>prog4.html</code></li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Structure your code with an <code>initShader</code> function capable of handling a variety of different shader programs. Again, store all program object and location state in a shader object.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>We have three objects to deal with. Each includes vertex positions and normals along with triangle indices. Unlike the previous project, the normals are calculated for you, and you should <em>not</em> recalculate them yourself.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>teapot.js</code></li>
				<li><code>plane.js</code></li>
				<li><code>cow.js</code></li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Structure your code with <code>initModel</code> and <code>drawModel</code> functions capable of handling any or all of the three models given. This will entail the creation and usage of a set of vertex buffer objects for each. Keep each model's VBO state separate by storing the VBOs <em>in the model object</em>.</p>

			<p>With these functions in hand, your application initialization should consist of three calls to <code>initModel</code> and three calls to
		</li>

		<li>Each of our previous projects placed the object at the center of the world. However, if all of our plants and trees are placed at the center, then they will all appear on top of one another. Instead, use the <code>modelView</code> matrix to <strong>translate</strong> them to different positions.</li>
	</ul>
