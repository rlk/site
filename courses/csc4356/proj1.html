  <h1>Project 1: Basic Interactive Rendering</h1>

  <p>The purpose of this project is to introduce the basic practice of OpenGL programming. This includes accessing and organizing geometry data, rendering it with illumination, and allowing user interaction with it. You must:</p>

  <h3>0. Find your footing</h3>

  <p>If you haven't already figured out how to compile and run C or C++ code using OpenGL and GLUT on your favorite platform, then this is your first step.

  <h3>1. Load a data file</h3>

  <p>3D models are provided in a very simple ASCII mesh file format that bears a passinge resemblance to the OBJ format. Note, however, that I devised this format myself in order to give you the necessary experience of parsing input. Plan on writing the file loader manually. If you google &ldquo;mesh file format&rdquo; you'll find yourself with a lot of meaningless and contradictory information. It's really very easy.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>The first line gives two integers: the number of vertices and the number of triangles in the mesh. Use these values to allocate buffers of the correct size to receive the geometry data.</p></li>

    <li><p>Second, the vertices are enumerated. Each appears on a separate line beginning with the character &lsquo;v&rsquo; followed by six floating point values: <i>px</i>, <i>py</i>, <i>pz</i>, <i>nx</i>, <i>ny</i>, <i>nz</i>, giving the 3D position and 3D normal vector of each vertex.</p></li>

    <li><p>Finally, the triangles are enumerated. Each appears on a separate line beginning with the character &lsquo;t&rsquo; followed by three integer values: <i>i0</i>, <i>i1</i>, <i>i2</i>, giving the indices of the vertices in the vertex list, numbered beginning with zero.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is a trivial example with 4 vertices and 2 triangles. It defines a square lying in the XZ plane, facing up.</p>

  <pre>
4 2
v -1.0 -1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
v  1.0 -1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
v -1.0  1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
v  1.0  1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
t 0 1 3
t 3 2 0
  </pre>

  <h3>2. Render</h3>

  <p>Use OpenGL vertex buffer objects to upload the geometry to the GPU and render it. Use the OpenGL fixed function pipeline to color and illuminate the geometry. Use the depth test to ensure that it appears correctly.</p>

  <h3>3. View</h3>

  <p>Allow the user to use the mouse and/or keyboard to tumble, pan, zoom, spin, or otherwise interactively view the object from any angle.</p>

  <h3>4. Be Flexible</h3>

  <p>Allow the name of input mesh file to be specified as a command line argument. Make sure these mesh files work correctly, and be prepared to demonstrate them working, but also be prepared to load and display <em>other</em> files with the same format.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="data/icosa.mesh">Icosahedron</a>
      <li><a href="data/teapot.mesh">Teapot</a>
      <li><a href="data/747.mesh">747</a>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Here is a <em>basic</em> example screenshot of the rendered 747. Remember your &ldquo;lagniappe&rdquo; requirement and <em>do something more interesting than this</em>.</p>

  <p>Try to have fun.</p>
