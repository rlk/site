<h1>Using Git with classes.csc.lsu.edu</h1>

<p>The following notes describe the procedure for setting up and using your <code>classes.csc.lsu.edu</code> account as a Git server. All programming projects for this course will be stored on that server and all assignment submissions will be made using Git repositories there. This mechanism provides a central location to store all your code, while allowing easy access to that code from your laptop, PC, or wherever.</p>

<p>For a full tutorial on the usage of Git, see the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Git Book</a>.</p>

<p>For a brief list of useful Git operations, see the <a href="https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">GitHub Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>

<a name="client"><h2>Set up the client</h2></a>

<p>Download and install the <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git client</a>. In this class, we will focus on command-line Git usage because this is the most general and powerful Git interface. It is also the most consistent between Windows, OS X, and Linux, so everyone in the class will see the same behavior and your new skills will translate across platforms.</p>

<p>Once installed, a tiny bit of client configuration is required. Use the following commands to tell the Git client who you are. It's critical that you use your LSU email address here, as this is the means by which the grader will know your work.</p>

<code><pre>
git config --global user.name "Mike Tiger VI"
git config --global user.email mtiger6@lsu.edu
git config --global push.default simple
</pre></code>

<p><b>You only need to do this once</b> for your client. You would need to do this a second time only if you wish to set up a second machine as a Git client.</p>

<a name="local"><h2>Set up a new local repository</h2></a>

<p>When working on a programming project, even if only by yourself, it's important to maintain the discipline of version control usage. Every project should have a <i>local</i> Git repository within it on your PC or laptop.</p>

<p>When starting a new project, you create a directory for it. This example assumes you're doing a programming project called &ldquo;<code>project0</code>&rdquo;.</p>

<code><pre>
mkdir project0
cd project0
</pre></code>

<p>Begin by initializing the Git repository for this project.</p>

<code><pre>
git init
</pre></code>

<p>This will create a hidden directory called <code>.git</code> within the <code>project0</code> directory.</p>

<a name="remote"><h2>Set up a new remote repository</h2></a>

<p>This course involves several programming projects. Each project will be submitted for grading via a Git repository stored on a Git server, in our case on <code>classes.csc.lsu.edu</code>. You'll create one such repository for each project.</p>

<p>To create a remote repository, you must SSH into your <code>classes</code> account. This example uses <code>cs4356XX</code> as login name.</p>

<code><pre>
ssh cs4356XX@classes.csc.lsu.edu
</pre></code>

<p>Once there, create a directory for the repository. If the local directory is called &ldquo;<code>project0</code>&rdquo; then the remote directory should be called "<code>project0.git</code>".

<code><pre>
mkdir project0.git
cd project0.git
</pre></code>

<p>Initialize a "bare" git repository there.</p>

<code><pre>
git --bare init
</pre></code>

<p>Now a new, empty Git repository exists in your account on the <code>classes</code> server. Remember that you're still connected to <code>classes.csc.lsu.edu</code> via <code>ssh</code> and disconnect before proceeding.</p>

<code><pre>
exit
</pre></code>

<a name="connect"><h2>Connect the local and remote repositories</h2></a>

<p>The work you do on your PC or laptop must be copied to the server. For this to happen, the location of the remote repository must be added to the local repository. This only needs to be done once, when these repositories are first created.</p>

<code><pre>
git remote add cs4356XX@classes.csc.lsu.edu:project0.git
</pre></code>

<p>With this connection made, we can &ldquo;push&rdquo; from local to remote for the first time, synchronizing the remote repository with the local repository.</p>

<code><pre>
git push -u origin master
</pre></code>

<a name="modify"><h2>Modify the local repository</h2></a>

<p>Do some work on the project. Create files. Modify files. Delete or rename files. Do what needs to be done. For this example, let's say you've created a new file called <code>README.md</code> that describes the content of your project (using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown syntax</a>).</p>

<p>At any time, we can ask Git for a summary of all of the changes made to your working copy:</p>

<code><pre>
git status
</pre></code>

<p>Requesting the status of the project tells you that <code>README.md</code> is "untracked". That means Git doesn't care about it, so let's first add it to the set of files that Git cares about.</p>

<code><pre>
git add README.md
</pre></code>

<p>Now, <code>git status</code> will tell you that <code>README.md</code> has "Changes to be committed". That means that the work you've done hasn't yet been stored permanantly, so let's commit those changes to the local repository. In so doing, we always include a message stating exactly what change we made.</p>

<code><pre>
git commit -m 'Added README'
</pre></code>

<p>With the commit complete, the local copy of your Git repository has embraced all of the additions you have made.</p>

<a name="sync"><h2>Synchronize the remote with the local</h2></a>

<p>After making changes and committing them to the local repository, do a &ldquo;push&rdquo; to synchronize the remote repository with the local repository.</p>

<code><pre>
git push
</pre></code>

<p>With that, the copy of the project on <code>classes.csc.lsu.edu</code> includes all of your additions and changes. That remote copy is definitive, and it is accessible to the instructor and the grader. When the project deadline arrives, we'll clone it ourselves and evaluate the work on the basis of that clone.</p>

<a name="clone"><h2>Clone a repository</h2></a>

<p>With the remote repository being definitive, your local repository is disposable, and you may often find yourself without a local copy of your project repository. This may happen because you want to work on different PC, or because you deleted or lost your local copy. This is a normal part of working with Git.</p>

<p>When you want to add content to a remote repository, you &ldquo;clone&rdquo; a local copy of it. You can then modify the contents by adding and changing files, and "push" the modifications back to the remote.</p>

<p>On your laptop or PC, move to a reasonable location for a working project and clone the project repository like so.</p>

<code><pre>
git clone cs4356XX@classes.csc.lsu.edu:project0.git
</pre></code>

<p>This creates a directory called "<code>project0</code>" in the current working directory. This directory contains a <i>local copy</i> of the project repository. It represents the current state of the project, but also contains hidden copies of all previous versions in the project's history.</p>
