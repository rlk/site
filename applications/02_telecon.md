## Autostereoscopic Video Telecommunications

*Fall 2005*

The Autostereoscopic Video Telecom application streams the output of a pair of FireWire cameras over high-bandwidth networks, each at 640&times;480 at 30Hz. This video, displayed using [Electro][] on a [Personal Varrier][varrier] stereoscopically depicts the remote user as a &ldquo;floating head&rdquo; with correct scale. Given that the Varrier does not require 3D glasses or other encumbrances to achieve view-adaptive stereoscopic virtual reality, the result is the first true two-way face-to-face VR communication medium. This technology was demonstrated at [iGrid 2005][igrid05] and [SuperComputing 05][sc05], and documented as a part of the [Global Lambda Visualization Facility][glvf].
