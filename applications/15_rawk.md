## [RAWK][rawk]

*Summer 2014*

[RAWK][rawk] is a command-line tool capable of performing a variety of image processing operations on very large raw binary image files. It provides a pannable, zoomable preview of the result of the process and enables image process parameters to be tuned interactively regardless of the scale of the input and output. A [manual with usage examples][manual] is included, as is a complete [class hierarchy][classes] for the implementation.
