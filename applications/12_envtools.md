## [Environment Mapping Tools][envtools]

*Spring 2013*

The [Environment Mapping Tools][envtools] are a set of command line utilities that operate upon spherical images in TIFF form. These operations including remapping between common spherical projections (cube map, equirectangular, dome master, fisheye, and mirror ball) and generating diffuse irradiance maps from specular environment maps.
