## [SYNASPAN][synaspan]

*March 2014*

[SYNASPAN][synaspan] is a short C program that synthesizes an all-sky panorama of the night sky from Hipparcos and Tycho-2 stellar catalog data. While the resulting image does *not* include nebulae or dust, the *absense* of stars in the catalog does lend structure to the visible portion of the local galaxy. Both galactic and equatorial coordinates are supported. The output image is pre-distorted to wrap spherically and may be arbitrarily large.
