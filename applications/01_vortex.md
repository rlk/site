## [Electro][]: Total Perspective Vortex

*Spring 2005*

Total Perspective Vortex is an Electro application capable of rendering a [database][] of 2,533,774 stars in real time 3D. The viewer is free to navigate within a volume 1,000 light-years in extent. Each individual star is drawn with correct brightness based upon viewing distance and absolute magnitude, correct color based upon spectral type, and correct representation as a Gaussian distribution of luminance. This is accomplished in real time using GPU vertex and pixel shaders. The 88 constellations are optionally depicted by lines connecting stars in 3D, allowing users to view the true 3D shape of constellations in space. Vortex is shown in [this YouTube video][youtube] running on EVL's 100-million pixel [LambdaVision][]. Source code is included in the [Electro][] distribution.
