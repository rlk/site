## [Panoptic][panoptic]

*Spring 2014*

[Panoptic][panoptic] is a cross-platform interactive tool for exploring giga-pixel spherical imagery. Executables for Windows, Linux, and OS X are provided. It's capable of rendering omnistereoscopic panoramas and high resolution planetary surfaces to a standard display, a stereoscopic display, or a head-mounted display. [Several gigabytes of example imagery][images] are available for download. This represents a public release of the software underlying the [panorama][panoview] renderer and the [Moonwall][orbiter] installation.
