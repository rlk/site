## [AVPan][avpan]

*Summer 2012*

[AVPan][] is simple command-line utility that bridges the gap between [LibAV][] and [Panotools][], giving a fully open source mechanism to stitch seamless panoramic video. AVPan was most recently used to merge the output of six GoPro Hero HD cameras carried to the edge of space on a [FarHorizons][] balloon. The image at the left is a frame from one of the [resulting videos][video]. This work was presented at the [International Planetarium Society Converence 2012][ips2012].
