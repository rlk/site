## [OVR_SDL2][ovr_sdl2]

[OVR_SDL2][ovr_sdl2] is a set of minimal cross-platform (Windows / Linux / OS X) example applications for the Oculus Rift written in C++ and depending only on [SDL2][], the [Oculus VR SDK][OVR], and [GLEW][]. Its intent is to encourage VR programmers to forego the use of off-the-shelf solutions and work closer to the metal.
