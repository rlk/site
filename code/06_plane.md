## [Plane Module][plane]

The [plane module][plane] is a very basic OpenGL code that renders a simple gridded plane as on the cover of Edward Tufte's [Visual Explanations][tufte]. This is often useful as a backdrop to simple 3D demos, and it represents an introductory example of vertex buffer object creation, population, and rendering.
