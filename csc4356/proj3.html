  <h1>Project 3: Per-pixel Illumination</h1>

  <p>The purpose of this project is to gain experience using GLSL to perform high quality illumination.</p>

  <h3>1. Scene</h3>

  <p>As with <a href="proj2.html">Project 2</a>, create a scene composed of at least two objects that you have created or downloaded, and make it interactively navigable. The <a href="../util3d/obj.html">OBJ module</a> is at your service. One of these objects must be the &ldquo;Thirteen Box&rdquo; (<a href="data/thirteen-box.obj">OBJ</a>, <a href="data/thirteen-box.mtl">MTL</a>, <a href="data/thirteen-diffuse.png">diffuse texture</a>, <a href="data/thirteen-normal.png">normal texture</a>, <a href="data/thirteen-specular.png">specular texture</a>).</p>

  <h3>2. Material</h3>

  <p>What distinquishes this from Project 2 is this: Your models must have texture-based materials consisting of at least <em>two</em> texture images. Most likely, these two textures will be a diffuse color map and a normal map, but you may be creative. Note that the required Thirteen Box meets this criterion.</p>

  <h3>3. Illumination</h3>

  <p>Complicating this ever so slightly, you must implement a GLSL spotlight using a projective texture. Let the spotlight be interactive in some fashion, perhaps like the viewing-point-1 example. Allow the user to select from between at least two spotlight textures.</p>

  <h3>4. Application Code</h3>

  <p>Enable the use of Tangent vectors in your application code. The OBJ Module will compute the tangent vectors for any textured model, but you'll need to make a point of linking your shaders in such a way that the OBJ module's use of vertex buffer objects is correctly mapped onto your shader's user-defined vertex attribute.</p>

  <h3>5. GLSL</h3>

  <p>Render the Thirteen Box correctly using tangent space normal mapping and diffuse and specular texturing. You've seen this done in class. Apply the same or similar per-pixel shading to your other objects.</p>

  <h3>6. Extra</h3>

  <p>As always, you may do whatever you like to meet your lagniappe requirement. Consider layered textures to add dirt and grime to an already-textured object. Try a procedural texture to enhance the detail of existing image textures. Cubic environment mapping would be great, and using the per-pixel normal to perform cubic environment reflection or refraction would be super-great.</p>

  <h3>6. Document</h3>

  <p>Once again, make a web site documenting your work completely. Include screenshots of your scene and materials. Include <em>all</em> source code and assets necessary to reproduce the project in a ZIP archive. Describe everything you've done and explain how it works in detail. Use your documentation to convince your instructor that you understand what you've presented instead of having simply copied it from a web site.</p>

  <p>See the <a href="index.html">main course web page</a> for details on submission, scheduling, scoring, and grading.</p>

  <p>Keep on keepin' on.</p>
