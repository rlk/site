## [3D Game with a Guy Flying a Pedal Plane][aw]

*Fall 2004*

In the fall of 2004 I started the Ph.D. program at UIC. My first class was Jason Leigh's [CS426 Intro to Video Game Programming][cs426]. The focus of this class was the development of a complete video game by a two-person team. The fall 2004 class was required to develop a 3D game to be run on EVL's [GeoWall][] stereoscopic 3D display. We implemented a game similar to Nintendo's [Pilot Wings][pilotwings]. The jury voted it the winner. The semester's platform was [BlitzBasic][], and my dissatisfaction with BlitzBasic was the impetus for the creation of [Electro][]. Since then, Nintendo has developed their own [stereoscopic Pilot Wings][resort] and I've gone on to lead the [game design course at LSU][csc4263].
