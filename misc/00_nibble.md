## [Nibble Magazine Two-Liner][nibble2]

*September 1990*

As a teen-age Apple II programmer, I was a *huge* fan of [Nibble Magazine][nibble]. Every issue contained deep technical knowledge and working code. Toward the back they'd print cleverly-tiny reader-submitted [AppleSoft BASIC][applesoft] programs, and in [September 1990][nibble1], they printed [my very first published code][nibble2]: BLOX, a program that assembles a Nibble logo out of sliding squares. [Source][source]. [Screenshot][snap]. As printed, there's a bug in it!
