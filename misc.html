        <p>My ongoing <a href="http://mamedev.org/">MAME</a> cabinet project is a departure from the norm. I want to preserve the form factor of the 1980s vertical arcade experience, but reinterpret it using lighter materials available today: LCD instead of CRT, <a href="http://8020.net/">80/20 extruded aluminum</a> and HDPE instead of MDF or plywood, LED instead of fluorescent lighting, and laser-cut acrylic instead of printed vinyl. I started by doing some <a href="misc/arcade0.png">CAD and previsualization</a>. The <a href="misc/arcade2.jpg">current state</a> of the real article is <a href="misc/arcade3.jpg">very slim</a>, <a href="misc/arcade4.jpg">self-contained</a>, and fully functional using an <a href="http://www.xgaming.com/">X-Arcade Tankstick</a>. All graphics and lighting remain to be done, and I'll upgrade to a hand-made control panel as the project proceeds.</p>

        <p>From 2001 to 2004 I worked 9-to-5 as a real-time visualization researcher at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA. In my free time during this period I developed a game similar to SEGA's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball">Super Monkey Ball</a>. I ported it to Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX, and I released it as freeware under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. Its popularity grew rapidly. It has had millions of users and is included on a number of Linux distribution installations. An international community of players, level designers, and Open Source developers formed around the game, meeting at the <a href="http://forum.nevercorner.net">Nevercorner Forum</a>. Work continues to this day, in open source fashion. Our <a href="https://s.snth.net/projects/neverball">project site</a> tracks bug reports and hosts a public source code repository and wiki. The game has become a favorite platform for hackers working with motion sensing devices such as the Nintendo Wiimote, the Apple Motion Sensor, and others.

The prevailing opinion is that Helvetica is a thing of beauty while Arial is an affront to the eye.

Discounting range, the differences are slim. To make these differences clear, I've overlaid Helvetica in magenta with Arial in cyan, and shown their intersection in black. <a href="pdfs/helvetica-vs-arial.pdf">Here is a 152K PDF</a> of the ASCII repertoire.</p>

        <p><em>August 2008</em></p>
        <p>Perspective projection is a well-understood aspect of 3D graphics. It is not something that 3D programmers spend much time thinking about. Most O<small>PEN</small>GL applications simply select a field of view, specify near and far clipping plane distances, and call gluPerspective or glFrustum. These functions suffice in the vast majority of cases. However, the field of Virtual Reality introduces circumstances under which they fail. <a href="pdfs/gen-perspective.pdf">This article</a> discusses the limitations of these perspective projection functions, and describes a more generalized perspective projection formulation. An implementation and example application are provided.</p>

        <p>Here's a custom color theme for Xcode 4 that I find appealing. Contrary to most syntax themes, this one is defined entirely in terms of a single hue, amber at 45&deg;. Syntax categories are distinguished by brightness, with keywords set in bold, program text in regular, and comments in italic. I use it with 13 point Consolas, as I really appreciate Consolas' italic. This theme is reminiscent of a VT420 MicroVAX console I used many years ago, but it'll probably remind most of the displays found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">Aperture Laboratories</a>.<p>

        <h3><a href="http://aoeu.snth.net/?p=7">Median Distance Projection</a></h3>
        <p><em>October 2007</em></p>
        <p>The real-time 3D perspective projection is normally defined in terms of near and far clipping plane distances. These values constrain the range of the scene and control the resolution of the depth buffer. They have the effect of clipping geometry this is too close to or too far from the camera. The Median Distance Projection algorithm reformulates the real-time 3D perspective projection in terms of the median of the scene. It extends the depth buffer range from zero to infinity. It is implemented in terms of a simple drop-in GLSL vertex function.</p>

The project implements a constrained particle dynamics system using GLSL pixel shaders. It simulates an electrically charged loop of ribbon. This was motivated by an ongoing collaboration between Kauffman and EVL co-founder <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/dan/">Dan Sandin</a>. They simulated knots in an effort to support the hypothesis that electrostatic repulsion would necessarily untie any non-knot loop. This GPU-based simulation allowed them to scale up their data set size by two orders of magnitude. The ribbon representation also enabled investigation of an apparent property of conservation of twist and coil in physical knots.

Physical objects interacting with the surface of the water drive a Verlet integration of the water's surface, implemented using GLSL pixel shading. GLSL shaders render the scene with per-pixel illumination and shadow mapping. The water surface is rendered with correct Fresnel mixing of reflected and refracted geometry, drawn to off-screen framebuffer objects. Submerged surfaces are rendered with approximated caustics and volumetric fog.</p>

        <p><em>Fall 2004</em></p>
        <p>In the fall of 2004 I started the Ph.D. program at UIC. My first class was Jason Leigh's <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/spiff/class/cs426">CS426 Intro to Video Game Programming</a>. The focus of this class was the development of a complete video game by a two-person team. The fall 2004 class was required to develop a 3D game to be run on EVL's <a href="http://geowall.geo.lsa.umich.edu/home.html">GeoWall</a> stereoscopic 3D display. We implemented a game similar to Nintendo's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilotwings_64">Pilot Wings</a>. The jury voted it the winner. The semester's platform was <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com">BlitzBasic</a>, and my dissatisfaction with BlitzBasic was the impetus for the creation of <a href="applications.html#electro">Electro</a>. Since then, Nintendo has developed their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilotwings_Resort">stereoscopic Pilot Wings</a> and I've gone on to lead the <a href="courses.html#csc4263">game design course at LSU</a>.</p>
