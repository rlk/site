        <p><em>May 2003&mdash;present</em></p>
        <p>From 2001 to 2004 I worked 9-to-5 as a real-time visualization researcher at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA. In my free time during this period I developed a game similar to SEGA's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball">Super Monkey Ball</a>. I ported it to Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX, and I released it as freeware under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. Its popularity grew rapidly. It has had millions of users and is included on a number of Linux distribution installations. An international community of players, level designers, and Open Source developers formed around the game, meeting at the <a href="http://www.nevercorner.net">Nevercorner Forum</a>. Work continues to this day, in true open source fashion. Our <a href="https://s.snth.net/projects/neverball">project site</a> tracks bug reports and hosts a public source code repository and wiki. The game has become a favorite platform for hackers working with motion sensing devices such as the Nintendo Wiimote, the Apple Motion Sensor, and others. Numerous videos may be found on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neverball&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f">YouTube</a>.</p>

        <p><em>2004&mdash;present</em></p>
        <p>Having developed <a href="#neverball">Neverball</a>'s ball physics simulator and OpenGL renderer, I set about creating a second game using these resources. The result is the miniature golf game Neverputt, for 1-to-4 players. Neverputt is distributed as a part of the Neverball source. Work on Neverputt continues alongside work done on Neverball. Players, level designers, and developers meet at the <a href="http://www.nevercorner.net">Nevercorner Forum</a>. Much to my surprise, Neverputt has became as popular as Neverball, with many players preferring it over its bigger brother.</p>

        <p>My final project for UIC's <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/525/index.html">GPU Programming</a> course provides a tutorial on day-night surface illumination using GLSL. It displays four dynamic light sources (two positional and two directional) illuminating a navigable animated scene with full shadow mapping. This application has been ported to the <a href="#varrier">Personal Varrier</a> virtual reality system.</p>

        <p>My third project for UIC's <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/525/index.html">GPU Programming</a> course crossed over with <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/">Lou Kauffman</a>'s course on <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/569.html">Knot Theory</a>, which I attended concurrently. The project implements a constrained particle dynamics system using GLSL pixel shaders. It simulates an electrically charged loop of ribbon. This was motivated by an ongoing collaboration between Kauffman and EVL co-founder <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/dan/">Dan Sandin</a>. They simulated knots in an effort to support the hypothesis that electrostatic repulsion would necessarily untie any non-knot loop. This GPU-based simulation allowed them to scale up their data set size by two orders of magnitude. The ribbon representation also enabled investigation of an apparent property of conservation of twist and coil in physical knots. This application has been ported to the <a href="#varrier">Personal Varrier</a> virtual reality system.</p>

        <p>My second project for UIC's <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/525/index.html">GPU Programming</a> course combines CPU-based physics, GPU-based physics, and real-time GPU rendering. An <a href="http://www.ode.org">ODE</a> rigid body dynamics system simulates junk littered about an abandoned quarry. Physical objects interacting with the surface of the water drive a Verlet integration of the water's surface, implemented using GLSL pixel shading. GLSL shaders render the scene with per-pixel illumination and shadow mapping. The water surface is rendered with correct Fresnel mixing of reflected and refracted geometry, drawn to off-screen framebuffer objects. Submerged surfaces are rendered with approximated caustics and volumetric fog.</p>

        <p><em>Fall 2004</em></p>
        <p>In the fall of 2004 I started the Ph.D. program at UIC. My first class was Jason Leigh's <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/spiff/class/cs426">CS426 Intro to Video Game Programming</a>. The focus of this class was the development of a complete video game by a two-person team. The fall 2004 class was required to develop a 3D game to be run on EVL's <a href="http://geowall.geo.lsa.umich.edu/home.html">GeoWall</a> stereoscopic 3D display. We implemented a game similar to Nintendo's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilotwings_64">Pilot Wings</a>. The jury voted it the winner. The semester's platform was <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com">BlitzBasic</a>, and my dissatisfaction with BlitzBasic was the impetus for the creation of <a href="#electro">Electro</a>.</p>
