## enOvation

*Fall 2013&ndash;Spring 2014*

enOvation was an initiative by the deans of the LSU College of Engineering and the School of Music and Dramatic Arts to encourage collaboration between students from these very disparate communities, Student groups formed with participants from each. They proposed projects and received a few thousand dollars to develop their ideas. I mentored a group including Bruno Beltran, Danny Holmes, Jessica Sprick, Kohl Thimmesch, Mitchell Mason, Tyler Rau, and Zachary Berkowitz. They developed a video game called *Erebus* that mapped skillful play onto generative music. This work was demonstrated at [FutureFest 2014][fest].
