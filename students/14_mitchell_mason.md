## Mitchell Mason

*enOvation 2013&ndash;2014, Honors thesis 2015*

Mitchell participated in the [enOvation](#enovation) program and also completing an Honors thesis in the field of virtual reality. Given the ready availability of the Kinect sensor and the Oculus head-mounted display, Mitchell developed a proof of concept for consumer-grade distributed shared augmented reality. He wrote an application to deliver the output of the Kinect over the network for display by the Oculus. Multiple users' Kinect point clouds are merged prior to display, allowing them to perceive that they are in the same room.
