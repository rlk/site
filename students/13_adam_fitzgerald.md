## Adam Fitzgerald

*Chancelor's Aide*

Adam made Kinect VR easy and reliable. He converted our [skeletal tracker](events.html#kinect-vr) from OpenNI to the Microsoft Kinect SDK and developed a [Windows tracker server with a GUI front end](https://github.com/gilphy/skeletal-tracker-app). This server delivers real-time skeleton data via UDP to all registered clients. The Kinect SDK is not as portable as OpenNI, but it works correctly without calibration and it doesn't crash. With Adam's work, Kinect VR became suitable for everyday use.
