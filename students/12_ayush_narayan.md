## Ayush Narayan 

*REU 2012*

Ayush vastly expanded the content of the real-time lunar visualization. He acquired several hundred gigapixels of LRO Narrow Angle Camera imagery, normalized it, and converted it to [SCM format][scm]. The resulting imagery was incorporated into the [Moonwall exhibit at the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum][orbiter].
