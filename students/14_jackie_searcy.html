<p><em>REU Summer 2014</em></p>

<p>Jackie took several steps toward improved photorealism in <a href="applications.html#panoptic">Panoptic</a>&#8217;s depiction of the planet Mars. She acquired and processed several Martian data sets for real-time display, she investigated the visual simulation of the Martian atmosphere, and she developed a GPU shader to synthesize high-resolution surface detail from coherent noise. <a href="pdfs/Searcy-SURF.pdf">Jackie&#8217;s poster</a> took 2nd place at the Summer Undergraduate Research Forum, and an image of her work was featured on the 2015 CCT REU T-shirt.</p>
