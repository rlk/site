<p><em>enOvation 2013&ndash;2014, Honors thesis 2015</em></p>

<p>Mitchell participated in the <a href="#enovation">enOvation</a> program and also completed an Honors thesis in the field of virtual reality. Given the ready availability of the Kinect sensor and the Oculus head-mounted display, Mitchell developed a proof of concept for consumer-grade distributed shared augmented reality. He wrote an application to deliver the output of the Kinect over the network for display by the Oculus. Multiple users&#8217; Kinect point clouds are merged prior to display, allowing them to perceive that they are in the same room.</p>
