<p><em>Chancelor&#8217;s Aide</em></p>

<p>Adam made Kinect VR easy and reliable. He converted our <a href="events.html#kinect-vr">skeletal tracker</a> from OpenNI to the Microsoft Kinect SDK and developed a <a href="https://github.com/gilphy/skeletal-tracker-app">Windows tracker server with a GUI front end</a>. This server delivers real-time skeleton data via UDP to all registered clients. The Kinect SDK is not as portable as OpenNI, but it works correctly without calibration and it doesn&#8217;t crash. With Adam&#8217;s work, Kinect VR became suitable for everyday use.</p>
