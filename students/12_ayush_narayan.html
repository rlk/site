<p>Ayush vastly expanded the content of the real-time lunar visualization. He acquired several hundred gigapixels of LRO Narrow Angle Camera imagery, normalized it, and converted it to <a href="research.html#scm">SCM format</a>. The resulting imagery was incorporated into the <a href="research.html#orbiter">Moonwall exhibit at the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum</a>.</p>
