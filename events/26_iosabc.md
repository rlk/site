## iOS App Boot Camp

*Summer 2013, 2014*

During the summers of [2013][abc2013] and [2014][abc2014], Jesse Allison, Tim Wright, and I presented a two-week iOS application development bootcamp, on of CCT's many [summer camps][camps]. We cover technical background in the first week, from Objective C to iOS Cocoa, and develop prototype apps the second.
