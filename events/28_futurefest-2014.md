## enOvation at FutureFest

*9 May 2014*

enOvation was a joint program of the [LSU College of Engineering](http://www.eng.lsu.edu/) and the [LSU College of Music and Dramatic Arts](http://www.cmda.lsu.edu/) that supported student projects combining engineering with performance. I mentored a group of students including Bruno Beltran, Mitchell Mason, Jessica Sprick, Danny Holmes, and Zachary Berkowitz, who constructed a sit-down video game cabinet and implemented an arcade shooter that responded to skillful play with evolving music. This project was installed at CCT's [Red Stick](https://redstickfestival.org/) FutureFest.
