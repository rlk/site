## [Panoptic](https://rlk.github.io/panoptic/) at PAX South and GDC

*23--25 January 2015, 2--6 March 2015*

CCT set up an expo booth at [PAX South](http://south.paxsite.com/) 2015 in San Antonio to promote our [DMAE](https://dmae.lsu.edu/) program. As a draw, we ran [Panoptic](https://rlk.github.io/panoptic/) on the Oculus Rift. Attendee interest in the Rift was *very* high and there were no other Rift demos at the show, so we had a 45-minute wait to see our tiny booth. This success led to an installation at [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) 2015, where we were just one of many.
