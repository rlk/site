## Kinect VR at the Breaking New Ground fundraiser

*20 April 2014*

Undergraduate Adam Fitzgerald developed a new [Skeletal Tracking Server](https://github.com/gilphy/skeletal-tracker-app) to drive our traveling [3D TV VR display](events.html#kinect-vr). We demonstrated this system at the kick-off of the LSU College of Engineering's [Breaking New Ground](https://www.eng.lsu.edu/news/2014/11/breaking-ground-on-110-million-renovation-and-expansion-of-engineering-campus/) campaign, an effort to raise funds for a $100 million renovation of Patrick Taylor Hall.
